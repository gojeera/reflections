When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you want to share your work with someone else or when you want to work on it when you're away.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If you hadn't commited changes to the local repository, having Git automatically pull the data may save over your work
