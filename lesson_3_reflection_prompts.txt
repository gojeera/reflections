When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you want to share your work with someone else or when you want to work on it when you're away.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If you hadn't commited changes to the local repository, having Git automatically pull the data may save over your work.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-Forks
		creating a repository off someone else's repository; you can edit and change files and commit to your repository without touching the original repository
	-Clone
		copying a repository from an external source (internet) to your local system
	-Branches
		commits that branch off of a master branch, additions for same project that can then be added to the master
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So it's always up-to-date and changes are then made to the most up-to-date of the master.  Also, there less changes to be made if there is conflicting versions.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Using something like Dropbox.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	Creating a branch will allow the ability to work on a new feature without affecting the master.  If there are multiple people working on the same project but on different elements it gives them the chance to work at the same time, and not having to wait around till one person finishes their part.
